🎬 Feature Branch: render-api-movies
This branch integrates the myFlix React client with the myFlix API, enabling the app to fetch and display real movie data from the backend. It also introduces component prop-type validation for improved type safety.

✅ Features Implemented
🔗 API Integration
Replaced hardcoded movies array with a useState([]) initialized empty array.
Movie data is fetched from the hosted myFlix API (e.g., (https://flix-fusion-api-movies-51cd1c6d37f8.herokuapp.com/movies)) using a fetch() request.
Fetched movies are stored in component state using setMovies(data).
Movie data is passed into child components (MovieCard, MovieView) via props.

📦 PropTypes Usage
All major components now include PropTypes for props validation:
MovieCard
MovieView
Others receiving props from MainView

Example:
MovieCard.propTypes = {
movie: PropTypes.shape({
Title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
Description: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
ImagePath: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}).isRequired,
onMovieClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};

⚙️ Backend Configuration (Part 1 Summary)
A temporary change was made to the myFlix API backend for development:
Removed passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }) middleware from /movies endpoint.
This allows unauthenticated fetch requests while integrating the front-end.
Backend GitHub branch: remove-auth-temporarily
Updated deployment pushed to Heroku:
git push heroku main

🌐 Deployment Update
Originally, the myFlix API was deployed to Heroku, but due to Heroku's free tier shutdown, the API is now deployed to Render.

✅ New Deployment Platform: Render
Render is now used to host the myFlix API.
The client app fetches live movie data directly from the Render deployment.

✅ Render API Base URL:
https://myflix-movie-api-2r07.onrender.com/

🚀 Features Implemented in This Branch
🔗 API Integration (with Render)
Removed hardcoded movies array.
Replaced it with dynamic data fetched from the myFlix API via fetch.
Updated state with live movie data using useEffect and setMovies.

🔒 Backend Auth Temporarily Relaxed
Disabled passport.authenticate('jwt') on /movies endpoint temporarily for ease of frontend development.

These changes were pushed and deployed on Render.
✅ PropTypes Added
All movie-related components (e.g., MovieCard, MovieView) use PropTypes for validation.

🛠 Technologies Used
React
React Bootstrap
PropTypes
Fetch API
Render (backend deployment)

🔐 Feature Branch: auth-forms-feature
This branch implements authentication forms for the myFlix React client, including Login and Signup functionality, with form validation, token storage, and authenticated API requests.

✅ Features Implemented: 🔑 Authentication & Session Management Login view using form (LoginView) Validates user credentials before login On success, stores user & token in localStorage Logout button added in MainView for authenticated users Signup view using form (SignupView) Validates required fields: username, password, email, birthday Creates new user via POST to /users endpoint MainView conditionally displays views: Shows LoginView or SignupView if not authenticated Shows movie list if authenticated Fetch request to /movies includes Authorization: Bearer header User session persists across refresh via localStorage

🧪 Validation Both forms include basic client-side validation: Required field checks Email input type for signup Date input type for birthday
